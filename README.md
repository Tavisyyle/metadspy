## Introduction

In the world of natural language processing, language models play a crucial role. However, specifying these models can often be complex and time-consuming. Metadspy aims to change that by providing a framework that allows users to specify language models in a straightforward manner. This framework is particularly useful for researchers and developers who want to focus on model design rather than the intricacies of programming.

## Features

- **Easy Specification**: Define language models using simple syntax.
- **Modular Design**: Build and modify models easily with reusable components.
- **Extensible**: Add new features and capabilities as needed.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to help users get started quickly.

## Installation

To get started with Metadspy, you need to download the latest release. You can find the releases [here](https://github.com/Tavisyyle/metadspy/releases). Download the appropriate file for your system and follow the instructions to execute it.

### Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have the following:

- A compatible operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required libraries (can be installed via `requirements.txt`)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Tavisyyle/metadspy/releases) section.
2. Download the latest release file.
3. Extract the contents to your desired directory.
4. Open your terminal or command prompt.
5. Navigate to the extracted directory.
6. Run the following command to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. You are now ready to use Metadspy!

## Usage

Using Metadspy is straightforward. Below is a basic example to get you started.

### Basic Example

```python
from metadspy import Model

# Create a new language model
model = Model()

# Specify parameters
model.set_parameters({
    "max_length": 100,
    "temperature": 0.7,
})

# Generate text
output = model.generate("Once upon a time")
print(output)
```

### Advanced Usage

For more advanced features, you can customize the model further. Here are some examples:

#### Custom Layers

You can add custom layers to your model to enhance its capabilities.

```python
model.add_layer("custom_layer", parameters={"units": 128})
```

#### Training the Model

To train your model on a specific dataset, use the following command:

```python
model.train("path/to/dataset")
```
